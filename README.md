badge. To access the older versions, navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/aerabi/hacktoberfest-cv/releases) section on the right.

This is the CV I created the first draft of, on Oktoberfest 2017.

## Development

To create a new release, simply add a tag to the corresponding commit and push to the main branch.
The CI/CD pipeline will then compile the $\LaTeX$ source code and create the release.
The badges are also automatically updated.
